Burst is a digital currency like Bitcoin but efficient mineable with free gigabytes instead of CPU / GPU or ASIC!

Everyone with free disk space can mine it and earn money. It's a truly decentralized and environment friendly alternative to Bitcoin.

You don't need special hardware.

How to use it:

Unzip and start Burst_Wallet.exe

It will take some hours until you can use the local wallet, because the Blockchain has to download in the background. 
You can use the 'Online' Wallet during this time.

All-in-one: With this wallet you can generate plots and mine them directly!
